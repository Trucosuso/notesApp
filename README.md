# Notes Web App
App for taking notes made in JavaScript.

With this proyect I have practiced with JavaScript classes, MVC and the Web Storage API.
I also used this project to practice git flow and semantic versioning (I know this software does not declare an API, but I tried to follow it loosely).

Current version live in https://trucosuso.github.io/notesApp/
